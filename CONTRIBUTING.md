### Opening a New Issue

- Avoiding duplicate issues organizes all relevant information for project maintainers and other users.
- If no issues represent your problem, please open a new issue with a good title and useful description.

- Information to Provide When Opening an Issue: 
    - version(s)
    - iOS version(s)
    - Devices/Simulators affected
    - Full crash log, if applicable
    - A well written description of the problem you are experiencing
    - *Please provide complete steps to reproduce the issue* 
    - For UI related issues, please provide a screenshot/GIF/video showing the issue 
    - Link to a project or demo project that exhibits the issue 
    - Search for a list any issues that might be related

The more information you can provide, the easier it will be for us to resolve your issue in a timely manner.

### Submitting a Pull Request

We maintain two permanent, protected branches: `master` and `development`.

`master` is for working on the current release, so any bug fixes or documentation spelling fixes should be merged into this branch.

`development` is where we stage work for the *next* release. Contributors should gently encourage new pull-requests to point to the appropriate branch, and to merge onto that branch if necessary.

When a new version is ready to be released, please create a pull request to merge `development` into `master`, named something like "Release 10.0". Then we can have some final discussion before we merge it into `master` and push the release out to the public.

Since `development` is a *shared* branch, it is important not to ever rebase this branch onto `master`.

**You should submit one pull request per feature, the smaller the pull request the better chances it will be merged.**
Enormous pull requests take a significant time to review and understand their implications on the existing codebase.

### Questions and Contact

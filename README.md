# PathFinder
Artemas J. Radik WWDC 2020 Swift Student Challenge Submission [ACCEPTED]. See https://github.com/ajradik/WWDC20-Swift-Student-Challenge for details.

Ever use Google maps? Well, Google maps uses a type of pathfinding algorithm in order to route you from your origin to your destination. PathFinder is simply a tool that visualizes how these types of pathfinding algorithms work. With PathFinder, you can visualize how the Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and A* pathfinding algorithms operate upon your own custom drawn graphs. Intended for use by computer science students. Available on iOS, ipadOS, and macOS.
